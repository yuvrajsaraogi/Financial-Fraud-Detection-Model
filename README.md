# 💳 Financial Fraud Detection Model

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect financial fraud using a variety of **machine learning** and **deep learning** models. The dataset comprises transactional data with features like transaction type, amount, and balance changes. The primary goal is to build accurate models that can classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **non-fraudulent**.
